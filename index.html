                    The National School of Sciences (NSS) is a premier education institute managed by the NIST
                    Foundation that was established nearly three decades ago. The core objectives of the foundation,
                    as an apex body, have been to establish education institutions, and provide students academic
                    programmes from pre–school to high school to university. Today, there are nine academic
                    institutions under the NIST Foundation across the Valley, and they offer different academic
                    programmes such as Science, Management, IT, Pharmacy, Food Technology, Microbiology among
                    others. I attribute the success of the institutions to the hard work, dedication and commitment
                    of our teachers, admin staff and leadership team and trust and support of parents, students and
                    other stakeholders.

                    During this long academic journey, thousands of students have graduated from the National School
                    of Sciences, let alone other institutions under the NIST Foundation. Therefore, we will focus
                    our
                    resources on building a strong leadership team, training and developing teachers and enhancing
                    the facilities so that all these institutions are adequately equipped, and able to produce
                    graduates who are globally competitiv5e, adaptable and lifelong learners.

                <h1>Plus 2 Programme</h1>
                <p class="para">
                    The school runs upper secondary (Grade 11 and 12) courses based on the national curriculum
                    prescribed by the National Examination Board (NEB). Earlier known as Plus 2 programme, this is
                    offered as a separate stand–alone two-year course that prepares students for undergraduate courses
                    at university. Upon successful completion of the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) i.e. Grade
                    10, conducted by the NEB, students are eligible to pursue Grade 11–12 course.

                    Upon enrolling in the course, students have the flexibility to choose elective subjects as per their
                    interest and career goals. The core subjects are mandatory for every student to pursue, and are
                    designed to provide in-depth knowledge and understanding. The academic programme is led by the
                    Principal ably supported by the Programme In–charges, Coordinators and a competent team of academic
                    faculty in addition to an experienced team of administrators. Currently, the school is providing
                    subjects related to Science and Management, and plans are afoot to offer other subjects related to
                    Law, Arts and Humanities in the future.

                        Plus 2, for nearly three decades. Started with a humble beginning from a total of 157 students

                        students in Grade 11 (both Science and Management programs). Through all these years of
                        providing academic service for aspiring students, the National School of Sciences has rightfully
                        carved a niche for itself and is acknowledged for providing quality education within an
                        affordable fee structure.

                        Enriching the learning experience of students has always been, and will be at the core of our
                        vision and mission, and we are always guided by the need to provide a conducive environment and
                        services for our learners to make their overall experience truly elevating. The need of the hour
                        demands a paradigm shift in the way we cater to the educational needs of the new generation of
                        learners. Today, education has to be imparted effectively through a balanced and holistic
                        approach to teaching–learning i.e. the development of the learner’s intellectual, emotional,
                        social, and personal skills, physical well-being, and artistic, creative, and spiritual
                        potential. The school seeks to engage students through a participatory approach to
                        teaching–learning process, and encourages personal and collective responsibility.
